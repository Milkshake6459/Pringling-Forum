Recently, I experimented with using different food items for pringling. I found that thinly sliced vegetables, like carrots and cucumbers, can create interesting textures. Have you experimented with any unconventional materials?",

I'll definitely give it a try! As for unconventional materials, I once experimented with incorporating small pieces of fabric into my pringling projects. It added an interesting tactile element to the chips. Have you tried incorporating any other materials?",
