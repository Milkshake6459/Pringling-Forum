# Pringling-Forum

The Pringling Forum is a project centered around cultivating a fake forum about a topic that doesn't exist.  Like model trains or Lego cities, I have set up the characters to interact with each other in the little box that I made for them.  The forum layout was kept simple in order to match the aesthetic of the golden age of forums (early 2000s) and also due to my lack of coding capabilities.  ChatGPT played a huge role in setting up the web elements, formatting the user data, and generating the characters' posts.  In fact, all of the posts are generated by ChatGPT.  Eventually, I would like to create more characters and flesh out more events in the forum's lifecycle.
